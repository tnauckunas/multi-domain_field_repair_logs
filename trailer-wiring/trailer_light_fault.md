# Trailer Light System Failure – Burned Wiring Pre-Diagnosis  
**Project Stage:** Damage documentation before repair  
**Date:** June 20–25, 2024  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Tow Vehicle:** Ford F-250 Super Duty  
**Trailer:** 24ft Rocksolid Enclosed Cargo Trailer

## Incident Summary

During a heavy-load haul through San Diego County on one of the hottest days of the year, the trailer lighting system fully failed — including tail lights, brake lights, and night-running lights.

Upon stopping for inspection, multiple failure points were identified:
- The trailer harness had **dragged on pavement**, severely **melting and exposing conductors**.
- Multiple internal wires were **burned and fused**, including **ground, tail, and brake wires**.
- The trailer’s **junction box** was heat-damaged and partially melted.
- The **rear light assembly** was no longer receiving any power.
- All exterior lights on the trailer were non-functional, creating a dangerous driving scenario.

## Visual Evidence & Damage Documentation

### 1. Exposed Trailer Harness – Severe Burn Damage  
![Exposed and melted trailer harness](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/trailer-wiring/damaged_harness_exposed.jpg?raw=true)

> Insulation completely ground off. Bare copper exposed. All wire paths compromised.

### 2. Burned Junction Box – Tongue Location

> Internal heat damage to wiring terminal area. System integrity broken.

### 3. Rear Trailer Lights Not Functioning

> Zero voltage to rear marker or brake/tail circuits. Green, white, and blue wires visibly burned.

### 4. Wire Routing Shot – Tow End (Before Repair)

> Cable entry point toward junction box. Tracing burned wire paths confirmed failure throughout full length.

## Status: Awaiting Full Repair  
This `.md` file documents full visual pre-repair damage only.  
A separate repair log will be created after complete harness and junction system replacement.

**Next Action:**  
- Cut damaged wiring  
- Rewire using 7-core marine-grade trailer harness  
- Replace junction box and confirm ground/voltage at rear light clusters  
- Full test cycle (brake, turn, night-running lights)

## Notes  
- Critical takeaway: Always inspect for **harness clearance near chains**  
- Drag + heat can cause catastrophic system-wide electrical failure in minutes  
- This log serves as a **before/after reference anchor** for multi-phase trailer jobs
