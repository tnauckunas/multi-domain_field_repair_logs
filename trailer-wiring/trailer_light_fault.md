# Trailer Light Failure – Burned Harness & Junction Box Repair  
**Project Type:** Emergency roadside electrical repair  
**Location:** San Diego County, California  
**Date:** June 20–25, 2024  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Trailer Type:** Enclosed 24ft Rocksolid Cargo Trailer (dual axle)  
**Tow Vehicle:** Ford F-250 Super Duty

## 🛠️ Problem Summary

While hauling the enclosed cargo trailer uphill on one of the hottest days in San Diego, the trailer lighting system suddenly failed — including all tail lights, brake lights, and night-running lights.

Upon inspection, the main wiring harness had **dragged against the pavement**, exposing internal wires. The outer casing was **melted**, and heat damage had **burned through adjacent wires**, creating shorts. The **junction box** at the trailer tongue was also visibly scorched.

This failure occurred mid-route, creating a **serious road hazard** due to lack of visibility and brake signal function.

## 🔍 Diagnostic Process

- Visual inspection of exposed harness confirmed **heat wear, grinding, and multiple exposed conductors**.
- Used multimeter to check continuity between pin outputs and light inputs — no voltage to rear cluster.
- Opened tongue junction box — found **charred insulation, melted terminals, and cross-wire fusion**.
- Verified the breakaway system was unaffected and isolated from damaged wiring.

## 🔧 Repair Process

1. **Harness Replacement**
   - Cut out ~3 feet of burned cable including melted junction segment.
   - Pulled new 7-core trailer wire through protective sleeve and re-routed with additional clearance from chains and moving components.

2. **Junction Box Rebuild**
   - Removed and replaced damaged plastic junction box.
   - Terminated all wires with heat-shrink ring connectors.
   - Rewired according to standard color map:
     - Brown – Tail/Running
     - Yellow – Left Turn
     - Green – Right Turn
     - Red – Brake
     - White – Ground
     - Blue – Electric Brake
     - Black – 12V Charge

3. **Testing**
   - Used tow vehicle with working 7-pin connector for live testing.
   - Verified each light function individually:
     - Brake: ✅
     - Left/Right Turn: ✅
     - Tail Lights: ✅
     - Reverse: ✅ (if equipped)
     - Clearance/Marker Lights: ✅
   - Secured all wire paths with cable clamps and zip ties.

## ✅ Final Outcome

Trailer lighting system was restored to full operational status. All rear and side marker lights functioned correctly, and the harness was reinforced with better routing to prevent future abrasion. Junction box was upgraded to weather-sealed enclosure. Trailer was returned to service same day.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Always **double-secure** harness routing — trailer chains can swing under force and shear cables.  
- Heat + friction = critical failure risk — insulation only buys time.  
- Keep emergency wiring kits and terminal hardware in long-haul tow rigs.
