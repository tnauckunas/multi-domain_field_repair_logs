# Coworker Honda CR-V Front-End Collision Repair (Assistance Log)

## Overview
- **Date:** June 30, 2024  
- **Vehicle:** Honda CR-V 2007
- **Event:** DIY crash repair > front-end damage

My coworker crashed his Honda CR-V and faced several thousand dollars in potential mechanic fees. Instead, I taught him how to do the full front-end teardown and component swap himself using salvage yard parts.

---

## Initial Damage Assessment
- Broken radiator and fan assembly  
- Dented front support and core structure  
- Misaligned headlight mountings  
- Exposed and unsecured wiring harnesses  
- Displaced bumper and metal brackets

---

## What We Did
- Fully disconnected the battery and isolated electronics.
- Removed damaged parts including:
  - Radiator
  - Broken fan
  - Bent support brackets
- Retrieved matching parts from a local junkyard.
- I guided the disassembly and ensured proper replacement fitment.
- The goal was **education + execution** — he did the hands-on work, I provided oversight and technical support.

---

## Outcome
- **Mechanic estimate:** $3,000+  
- **DIY cost:** ~$250 in parts  
- **Result:** Successful disassembly and start of reassembly. Saved thousands. Gained real-world mechanical experience.

## Reflections
> **"If you want to learn, get your hands dirty."**  
Doing it yourself not only saves money, it builds confidence. I watched a coworker go from nervous to empowered by the end of this project.
