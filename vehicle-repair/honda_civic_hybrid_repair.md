## Reconditioning Phases

### **Cycle 1 — Initial Discharge**
- **Voltage:** 189V  
- **Discharge Current:** ~1.4A  
- **Termination Voltage:** 105V  

### **Cycle 2 — Initial Recharge**
- **Voltage:** 178V  
- **Charge Current:** ~3.3A  
- **Termination Voltage:** 66V  

### **Cycle 3 — Final Deep Discharge + Full Recharge**
- Extended the discharge to ~13V for deeper cell balancing  
- Final recharge brought the pack back to stable baseline  
- Charging indicators began functioning again

### Outcome
- Hybrid battery successfully revived.
