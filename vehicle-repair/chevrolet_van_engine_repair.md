## Troubleshooting & Testing
- Inspected ignition coils and spark plugs â€” plugs were worn but not root cause.
- Used carb cleaner to spray vacuum lines and intake â€” detected idle fluctuation, indicating vacuum leak.
- Smoke tested system â€” confirmed minor leaks at intake gasket and around throttle body base.
- Listened for knock sensor signal during idle with stethoscope â€” inconsistency confirmed sensor degradation.

## Repairs Performed
### 1. Intake System Disassembly
- Removed engine cover and throttle body.
- Disconnected and labeled fuel rail, injector clips, vacuum lines, and harnesses.
- Pulled intake manifold to access valley pan area and knock sensor harness.

### Notes
- This job required working through the doghouse (interior engine access) under the dashboard.
- Multiple components had to be maneuvered in tight quarters; careful labeling of connections was key.
- Total repair time: ~6 hours including testing and cleanup.
