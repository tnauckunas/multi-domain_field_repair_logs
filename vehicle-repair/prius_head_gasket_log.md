# Prius Head Gasket Replacement Log

**Vehicle:** 2015 Toyota Prius  
**Issue:** Engine shaking, misfires, coolant loss, and check engine light (trouble code not documented due to urgency)  
**Time Constraints:** Repair was performed under extreme time pressure. Documentation began only during reassembly.  
**Tools Used:**  
- Hand-tools  
- Creeper  
- LED work stand  
- Complete hand tool set  
- ALLDATA DIY: 2015 Prius official repair procedure

## Symptoms

- Rough engine idle and excessive vibration  
- Coolant loss with no visible external leak  
- Engine light triggered (code not saved)  
- Imminent need for transportation forced urgent teardown without time for full photo documentation

## Work Summary

- Fully disassembled engine top-end including intake, throttle body, air filter box, ignition coils, valve cover, and timing chain cover  
- Removed camshafts and cylinder head  
- Sent cylinder head to local machine shop:
  - Head was resurfaced (machined)
  - Valve springs, lifters, retainers, and valve stems tested and passed  
- Installed brand new multi-layer OEM head gasket  
- Installed new OEM head bolts and torqued in proper multi-stage star pattern using official Toyota spec from ALLDATA  
- All sealing surfaces cleaned and prepped  
- Engine reassembled in full, including proper timing chain alignment and torque sequences  
- Fluids flushed and replaced  
- Successful startup on first ignitionâ€”no leaks, no misfires, proper idle

## Notes

- This repair was completed solo, with no supervision, under pressure to have the vehicle operational within 72 hours  
- No step skipped, all torque specs and sequences followed precisely  
- Total down time: ~3 days including machine shop delay  
- Post-repair testing showed full resolution of symptoms and no recurrence  
- Transmission was rebuilt prior with same self-reliant process (no images due to rush)
