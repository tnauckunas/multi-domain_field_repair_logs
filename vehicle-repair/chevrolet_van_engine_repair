# Chevrolet Express Van Engine Repair & Rear Wiring Install

## Vehicle:

* **Make/Model**: Chevrolet Express Van
* **Repair Areas**: Engine troubleshooting and component replacement, rear trailer wiring install

---

## Engine Diagnostics & Repair

### Initial Symptoms:

* Severe engine misfiring
* Rough idling and shaking
* Check Engine Light (CEL) present
* Trouble codes retrieved via scan tool:

  * **P0171** â€“ System Too Lean Bank 1
  * **P0301** â€“ Cylinder 1 Misfire Detected

### Troubleshooting Performed:

* Removed engine cover from cabin for full access to intake manifold, fuel rails, and wiring harness.
* Conducted visual inspection of all ignition coils and spark plug wires â€” all visibly worn.
* Verified fuel injector pulse and spray pattern using test light and audio stethoscope.
* Tested ignition coil resistance and primary/secondary continuity.
* Checked intake manifold gaskets for potential vacuum leaks.
* Verified knock sensor resistance and wire condition.

### Parts Replaced:

* **Spark Plugs** (full set)
* **Ignition Coils** (as needed based on resistance testing)
* **Knock Sensor** (new sensor installed deep under the intake manifold)
* **Upper Intake Manifold Gaskets**

### Additional Work:

* Cleaned intake ports and throttle body
* Re-torqued manifold bolts per OEM sequence
* Cleared all codes and performed engine relearn drive cycle

## Rear Trailer Wiring Install

### Objective:

* Install 4-pin trailer connector in rear cargo section for external trailer lighting.

### Work Completed:

* Routed wiring from rear tail light harness inside van cargo bay.
* Tapped into turn, brake, and tail circuits using soldered connections.
* Heat-shrinked all joints and wrapped loom for durability.
* Tested with trailer light tester for full signal pass-through:

  * Left Turn
  * Right Turn
  * Brake
  * Tail Lights

## Tools Used:

* Topdon ArtiDiag600S Diagnostic Scanner
* Basic and deep socket wrench set
* Spark plug socket extension
* Test light, stethoscope, multimeter
* Soldering kit, heat shrink tubing, wire stripper

---

## Outcome:

* Engine now idles smooth, starts reliably, and all misfire/lean codes cleared permanently.
* Trailer wiring fully functional and secured inside cargo bay.

---

## Notes:

* Knock sensor access on this van requires near-complete removal of intake manifold, which was documented with careful reassembly tracking.
* Vehicle was returned to regular duty after 3 days of continuous work.
