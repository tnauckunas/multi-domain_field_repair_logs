## Common Issues Encountered  
- Burner ignition failure (especially front-right / back-left)  
- Weak or inconsistent flame output across burners  
- Turbo convection fan not activating  
- Uneven cooking inside oven cavity  
- Warped or missing oven trays  
- Heavy grease buildup interfering with burner and fan function

## Troubleshooting & Fixes

### Burner Ignition  
- Check igniter electrodes for carbon buildup or physical damage  
- Test continuity on igniter wires, replace if open circuit  
- Clean burner heads, jets, and venturi tubes with brush + compressed air  
- Verify spark function (visible spark and audible click)  
- Adjust air shutters for proper flame mix  

### Flame Output  
- Clean all burner jets and remove debris  
- Inspect gas regulator and manifold pressure  
- Ensure burner caps are seated correctly  
- Verify gas hose condition and seal integrity  

### Convection Fan  
- Remove rear oven panel to access turbo fan motor  
- Test motor resistance, replace if open or seized  
- Check wiring from control board to motor  
- Test in convection mode after replacement  

### Oven Heating  
- Inspect thermocouple and thermostat sensors  
- Use oven thermometer to verify heat distribution  
- Replace warped trays to prevent airflow disruption  
- Clean interior walls and base to restore reflective heat performance

## Test Protocol (Post-Repair)

| Component        | Test                          | Pass Criteria                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Burners          | Manual ignition + visual test | Instant spark, stable blue flame |
| Convection Fan   | Convection mode test          | Fan spins at full speed          |
| Oven Heat        | Bake mode temp test           | Even 180–200°C across cavity     |
| Ignition System  | Spark test on all zones       | Consistent click + arc           |
| Gas Safety       | Leak test w/ soap solution    | No visible bubbles               |
