- Verified gas flow: 
- Checked igniter clicks and spark output: 
- Multimeter test on igniter wires: No continuity on front-right and back-left ignition wires

- Removed burner caps and heads: Found debris and blocked gas ports  
- Cleaned jets and venturi tubes with wire brush and compressed air  

### 3. **Fan Failure (Double Turbo Convection)**  
- Power output from control board to fan motor:  
- Fan motor resistance check: (Open circuit)  
- Confirmed failed convection fan motor  

### 4. **Uneven Oven Cooking**  
- Thermocouple check: Functional  
- Identified warped bottom oven tray causing airflow disruption  
- Confirmed with thermal camera: Hot spots in back-right quadrant
