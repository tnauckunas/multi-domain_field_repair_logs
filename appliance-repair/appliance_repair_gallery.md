### Open-Air Repair Yard – Multi-System Station  
![Multiple washers and dryers staged in open repair zone](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/appliance-repairs/open_yard_multiple_units.jpg?raw=true) 

This open-air repair zone was used to triage, diagnose, and clean over 10 separate machines. Each unit had different failure points from drain pump clogs to blown thermal fuses and was assessed individually. Tools, power, and hose connections were routed for mobile access and on-the-fly testing.

### Mid-Repair – Hose Flush & Cleaning Phase

These units were in active repair phase. Hoses removed, drained, and re-tested for leaks and clog resistance. Drain pump impellers and internal grates were flushed and cleared manually.

### Solo Transport – Prius Hatch Method

No truck? No problem. I regularly transported washers and dryers using my personal Prius hatchback. This front-load unit was secured with moving blankets and lateral support to prevent bounce or drum shift. While unconventional, this method allowed rapid pickup and drop-off for multi-unit servicing without the need for a rented cargo or company vehicle.

### Solo Commercial Oven Haul – 300+ lbs
![Commercial stove loaded into back of a pickup truck](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/appliance-repairs/solo_commercial_stove_rig.jpg?raw=true)

This commercial stove weighed well over 300 lbs and needed to be moved solo with a partially injured right arm. With no one available to help, I created a strap-anchored system that used the pickup truck as a stabilizer. I gradually ratcheted the stove upward against the ramp tension while managing balance and friction. This move took over an hour and was executed entirely by hand at night. I later brought the unit home for full repair and resale. One of my most difficult field hauls to date.

### Incoming Units – Unchecked & Untested  
![Incoming washer/dryer units pending inspection](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/appliance-repairs/unverified_stack_pair.jpg?raw=true) 

These unverified units were staged for pre-inspection. Common failure points included lid locks, heating elements, motor control boards, and spin belt alignment.

### ✅ Miele Washer + Dryer Stack – Fully Restored
![Fully repaired and cleaned high-end units](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/appliance-repairs/miele_pair_resale_ready.jpg?raw=true)

This Miele washer and dryer set was acquired non-functional. The washer required drain clearing, error reset, and door latch inspection; the dryer needed vent trap and filter housing realignment. Both units were fully disassembled, cleaned, and tested across multiple cycles. Final condition shown here as ready for resale. Miele is one of the most sought-after brands in U.S. appliance markets, and this stack was brought back from discard to premium resale condition.

### ✅ Restored Pair – Samsung + LG Front Load  
![Fully repaired and cleaned high-efficiency units](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/appliance-repairs/restored_lg_samsung_pair.jpg?raw=true) 

This pair was fully disassembled, cleaned, restored, and tested. UI, cycle behavior, and door latch integrity were confirmed across normal, heavy-duty, and quick wash settings.

### ✅ Whirlpool + GE Classic Models – Operational  
![Final resale-ready classic units](https://github.com/tnauckunas/multi-domain_field_repair_logs/blob/main/assets/appliance-repairs/classic_pair_cleaned.jpg?raw=true)

Final product stage. Cleaned, tested, and photographed for listing. Both passed multi-cycle QA and no power, heating, or drainage issues remained.
