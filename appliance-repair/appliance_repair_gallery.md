### 🧰 Open-Air Repair Yard – Multi-System Station  
![Multiple washers and dryers staged in open repair zone](../assets/appliance-repair/open_yard_multiple_units.jpg)  

This open-air repair zone was used to triage, diagnose, and clean over 10 separate machines. Each unit had different failure points — from drain pump clogs to blown thermal fuses and was assessed individually. Tools, power, and hose connections were routed for mobile access and on-the-fly testing.

These units were in active repair phase. Hoses removed, drained, and re-tested for leaks and clog resistance. Drain pump impellers and internal grates were flushed and cleared manually.

### 🚗 Solo Transport – Prius Hatch Method  
![Front-load washer loaded into a Prius hatchback](../assets/appliance-repair/washer_transport_in_prius.jpg)  

No truck? No problem. I regularly transported washers and dryers using my personal Prius hatchback. This front-load unit was secured with moving blankets and lateral support to prevent bounce or drum shift. While unconventional, this method allowed rapid pickup and drop-off for multi-unit servicing without the need for a rented cargo vehicle.

### 🔄 Incoming Units – Unchecked & Untested

These unverified units were staged for pre-inspection. Common failure points included lid locks, heating elements, motor control boards, and spin belt alignment.

### ✅ Restored Pair – Samsung + LG Front Load  
![Fully repaired and cleaned high-efficiency units](../assets/appliance-repair/restored_lg_samsung_pair.jpg)  

This pair was fully disassembled, cleaned, restored, and tested. UI, cycle behavior, and door latch integrity were confirmed across normal, heavy-duty, and quick wash settings.
