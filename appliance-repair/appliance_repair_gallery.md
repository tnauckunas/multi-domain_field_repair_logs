### ðŸ§° Open-Air Repair Yard â€“ Multi-System Station

This open-air repair zone was used to triage, diagnose, and clean over 10 separate machines. Each unit had different failure points â€” from drain pump clogs to blown thermal fuses and was assessed individually. Tools, power, and hose connections were routed for mobile access and on-the-fly testing.

These units were in active repair phase. Hoses removed, drained, and re-tested for leaks and clog resistance. Drain pump impellers and internal grates were flushed and cleared manually.

No truck? No problem. I regularly transported washers and dryers using my personal Prius hatchback. This front-load unit was secured with moving blankets and lateral support to prevent bounce or drum shift. While unconventional, this method allowed rapid pickup and drop-off for multi-unit servicing without the need for a rented cargo vehicle.

These unverified units were staged for pre-inspection. Common failure points included lid locks, heating elements, motor control boards, and spin belt alignment.
