## Issue Overview

Unit powered on, drum rotated properly, but no heat was produced during cycle. Clothing remained cold and damp after full timed dry setting. UI showed no error codes.

---

## Diagnostic Process

* Removed rear panel to access thermal fuse, high-limit thermostat, and heating element
* Used multimeter to test:

  * Thermal fuse → continuity
  * Thermostat → continuity
  * Heating element → open circuit
* Visual inspection showed coil break near lower terminal

---

## Repair Steps

* Removed damaged heating coil unit
* Replaced with universal-fit heating element kit (coil + ceramic mounts)
* Verified wiring match to manufacturer diagram
* Cleaned internal lint, dust buildup, and heat flow chamber
* Reinstalled rear panel and secured terminals

---

## Final QA & Test

* Powered unit → selected Normal cycle
* Thermostat engaged, heating element activated at \~240V
* Drum ran quiet, heat ramped up evenly
* Measured air temp at vent \~145°F during peak
* Completed 30-minute cycle with dry towel test load

✅ Heating fully restored

✅ No thermal cutoff trip

✅ Coil visually glowing and cycling correctly

## Notes

This unit was recovered using a low-cost universal element replacement. Original OEM part was backordered. All tests were verified using standard multimeter + thermal tape for vent temp.
