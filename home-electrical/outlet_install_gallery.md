# Home Electrical Outlet Install & Safety Testing

## Outlet Installation Overview

**Project:** New outlet installation for studio conversion  
**Scope:** Wired and installed multiple standard 15A duplex outlets across newly finished wall and living area  
**Location:** Laundry wall, bedroom zone, breaker-fed layout  
**Objective:** Ensure each outlet was securely wired, grounded, and spaced cleanly

## Safety Testing Process & Notes

After installation, I conducted a full safety check using a multimeter and visual inspection method:

- **Ground Test:** Verified ground continuity across all outlets using continuity test with neutral disconnected
- **Voltage Test:** Verified correct 120V between hot and neutral, and 120V between hot and ground
- **Neutral Check:** No voltage between neutral and ground
- **Polarization:** Confirmed wide blade = neutral (silver screws), narrow blade = hot (brass screws)
- **Connection Check:** All screws torqued to spec, no insulation pinched, no loose strands

### Reference Wiring Diagram  
Diagram used to verify terminal orientation and screw placement.

The diagram below wasn’t exactly what I was looking for, but it provided a solid general understanding and helped confirm the orientation of hot, neutral, and ground terminals.


**Result:** Every outlet passed inspection. The studio was powered on without any faults. Installed outlets were grounded, polarized, and safely operational.
