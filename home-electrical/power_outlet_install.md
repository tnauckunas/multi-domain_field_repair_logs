# Studio Electrical Outlet Installation Log

## Project Summary

**Location:** Studio Remodel  
**Time:** Night work, full day shift  
**Scope:** Installed new electrical outlets throughout the studio, including utility wall and living area. Verified correct grounding and neutral alignment.  
**Tools Used:** Voltage tester, flathead and Phillips screwdrivers, needle-nose pliers, drill, level, and cable strippers.  
**Breaker Safety:** All work performed with breaker fully shut off and verified zero voltage at connections.

## Wiring Setup

- **Black (Hot)** → Brass terminal  
- **White (Neutral)** → Silver terminal  
- **Copper (Ground)** → Green terminal and box ground screw  
- Confirmed tight screw torque and no stripped insulation. Ground loop wrapped correctly.

## Inspection and Final Pass

- Verified outlet polarity with plug-in tester.
- All grounds checked for continuity to panel ground.
- Conducted double-visual check before push-in.
- Outlets installed flush and leveled.
