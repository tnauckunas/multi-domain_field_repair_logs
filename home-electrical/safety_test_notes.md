# Safety Test Notes â€“ Outlet Wiring Verification

**Scope:** Safety testing and verification of standard outlet installations during full unit electrical setup.

**Environment:** Newly constructed studio with multiple outlets installed. Final review done during nighttime work.

## Wiring Diagram Reference

The following diagram was used as the primary guide for verifying outlet wiring accuracy:

**Key Points from Diagram:**
- **Line (Hot):** Connected to brass screws on the narrow blade side.
- **Neutral (N):** Connected to silver screws on the wide blade side.
- **Ground (Earth):** Connected to green screw and/or ground bar.

## Safety Test Procedure

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Verified **black (hot)** wire connected to **brass screws**.
   - Verified **white (neutral)** wire connected to **silver screws**.
   - Verified **bare copper (ground)** securely screwed into **green ground terminal**.

2. **Continuity Test**
   - Used multimeter to test continuity between hot/neutral/ground before power-on.

3. **Circuit Breaker Confirmation**
   - Ensured all breakers were **OFF** during wiring and only flipped **ON** post-confirmation.

4. **Voltage Test (Live)**
   - Used a non-contact voltage tester and multimeter to validate:
     - **120V AC** between hot and neutral.
     - **120V AC** between hot and ground.
     - **0V** between neutral and ground.

5. **Load Test**
   - Plugged in a **load tester** and verified proper grounding and wiring integrity (green light = pass).

## Final Notes

- **Breakaway tabs** were left **intact** since all duplex outlets were wired from a single circuit.
- Outlets were securely mounted and aligned with wall surface.
- Safety was prioritized and no live wires were exposed during any phase.
